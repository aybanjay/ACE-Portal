            1.     Choose PHINMA Education <br>
<br>2.    As an innovative Philippine business institution, PHINMA believes that access to quality education is the solution to many of our country’s problems. While the enrollment rate in the Philippines has always been high, PHINMA discovered that most students do not finish tertiary education. Students were willing to learn but did not have the resources to stay in school.<br>
<br>3.    That is why in 2004, PHINMA Education was established.<br> 
<br>4.    PHINMA Education is making education accessible in key growth areas all over the country. It has transformed existing educational institutions to provide better academic, operational, and community support for all of its students. Through its efforts more students are able to earn college degrees and become globally competitive professionals. <br>
<br>5.    The PHINMA Education Network is now composed of nine secondary and tertiary educational institutions spread throughout the country.<br>
<br>6.    The story of the PHINMA University of Pangasinan started in 1925. Francisco Benitez, Dr. Apolinario de los Santos, Dr. Sylvestre Pascual and Dr. Blas F. Rayos, all esteemed Pangasinenses, built the Dagupan Institute, a school which offered primary, secondary, and vocational education. The Institute was renamed to Dagupan Junior College after the Second World War, expanded its course offerings and added a Graduate School. In 1950, the school was transformed and became Dagupan Colleges. The school continued to provide more courses to fulfill its commitment of delivering excellent education to the youth not just in Pangasinan, but Northern Luzon. Dagupan Colleges was granted university status through the University Charter of the Department of Education, and was given the name University of Pangasinan. PHINMA Education is under the PHINMA Group of Companies, the first Filipino-managed investment firm. Established in 1956, PHINMA seeks to make life better for each Filipino with its businesses in the education, energy, financial services, hospitality, real estate, steel and strategic consultancy businesses. PHINMA Education’s current roster of schools include: Araullo University, Nueva Ecija, Cagayan de Oro College, University of Iloilo, Southwestern University, Cebu, St. Jude College, Manila, Rizal College and Union College both in Laguna and in Indonesia.
